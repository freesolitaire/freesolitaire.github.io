## Game Overview
The total number of cards in **[Free Solitaire](https://freesolitaire.github.io)** stands at 104 which comprises two separate decks of 52 cards each. The card configuration requires descending arrangement subject to rules which depend on the chosen game difficulty mode.

## Playing Field

### Tableau
The central display area known as the **tableau** contains all 54 cards organized by ten face-up vertical stacks. Each list contains ten cards which reveal only the top member for play.

### Stock
The **stock** contains all remaining unplayed cards which number 50. Tapping the stock allows distribution of extra cards across the tableau.

### Foundation
The finished sequences are stored within the **foundation** section of the game. The cards will automatically move to this section only when they are arranged in descending order starting from the **King through to the Ace** based on the same suit.
## Objective of the Game

Playing the game requires a proper sequence of moving cards which begins at the **tableau** section and continues toward the **foundation** area. A proper arrangement of cards in descending order and correct suit sequence inside the tableau allows them to become eligible for transfer to the foundation.

## Difficulty Levels
Free Solitaire offers three difficulty levels:

### 1 Suit

### 2 & 4 Suits

- A sequence must belong to the same suit before it can travel to the foundation.

1. Tableau cards should move downward through their ranks.
2. Clear the cards positioned above for exposure of hidden cards that lie face-down.
