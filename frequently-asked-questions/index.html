    <h2 class="article_title">What is the story behind the free Solitaire?</h2>
    <p class="article_text">The majority of games belonging to the Solitaire family continue to exist since centuries but Spider Solitaire represents a more recent entry into the family. Historians have not yet determined the origin of the game although an early documentation of its name was published in 1917 in a book presenting diverse card game rules. The game achieved world-wide popularity after Microsoft began including it within their operating system packages. The game first appeared in Windows 98 Plus games releases before every edition of Windows maintained this game feature. Our website variant follows Microsoft rules which means we retain their established scoring system and rules format.</p>
    <h2 class="article_title">The task to draw fresh cards from the stockpile remains beyond my ability.</h2>
    <p class="article_text">The only essential requirement in free Solitaire requires at least one card per table column before the stock can be dealt. Additional card deals are impossible unless all tableau columns contain at least one card. Playing a single card into existing empty columns makes it possible to restart the dealing sequence.</p>

    <h2 class="article_title">Statistics in my account reset automatically without notice. Why has this happened?</h2>
    <p class="article_text">Multiple methods exist to reset the statistics data. To reset statistics data you should use the reset button available in the statistics window. The reset operation establishes everything at zero value. The statistics data gets saved within your Internet browser's cache folder. Clearing your cache by hand leads to the loss of all your statistics data. </p>
    <h2 class="article_title">What methods do I have to communicate with the game system?</h2>
    <p class="article_text">The game provides dual functionality for gameplay. The game presents two playing options where you either drag cards with your mouse or finger while placing them in chosen locations or you can automatically move cards to appropriate positions by clicking them. Users have a second method of interaction by choosing to click or tap on the cards. After tapping a card the game will direct it to the most suitable position in the tableau automatically. The touchscreen permits users to shift pieces by employing finger gestures.</p>

    <h2 class="article_title">Free Solitaire Scoring System,</h2>
    <p class="article_text">Users can find numerous free Spider Solitaire games throughout the market. A few versions have developed their individual scoring systems. The scoring system we implement derives from Microsoft's original design standards developed by their programmer team. According to this scoring method all rounds initiate with 500 points. Your points value decreases whenever you use a card for movement. Both dealing from stock and activating the undo function require 1 point each and these steps remain the same at every level. Clearing full sequences of K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, A cards to the foundation will give you points in the game. Every cleared sequence awards you 100 points under this scoring system.</p>
    <p class="article_text">For example: You finished the game when reaching step 120 of the game. The default 500 points suffer a deduction of the 120 steps played which results in a final score of 380. A game reaches its end when eight sequences become available in the foundation areas. There are eight sequences that each award 100 points which sum to reach 800 points total. The accumulated total of 1180 points results from adding foundation scores of 800 points to initial points of 380 points. </p>
    <p class="article_text">Conclusion: The achievement of a high score in Spider Solitaire requires players to finish the game through the minimum number of moves. You can easily achieve higher scores in single-suit Spider Solitaire than in the remaining two levels due to the higher number of steps needed to finish the other levels. The application contains distinct statistical systems for its three game modes which you can reset independently to ensure fairness.</p>
    <h2 class="article_title">The free Spider Solitaire application stalls during launch time. What can I do?</h2>
